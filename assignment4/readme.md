# Problem Statement

In this assignment you will enhance the instruction set simulator developed in Assignment 3, to also incorporate delays. Assume that you will be given a file that indicates the information of how many clock cycles each instruction requires.

A sample input file with delay values of each instruction is given (latency.txt).

Print out statistics about the clock cycle counts and average Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) for the input program.
